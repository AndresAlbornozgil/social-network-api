# Social Network Api

## Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This project was built mainly with the idea of practicing how to build and test routes with insomnia. I learned that back-end development it's all about connecting things and that insomnia is very simple to use.
